useSelector: to get something from a redux-store.
useDispatch: to useDispatch something / send information.

slice up scripts so they only are dependent on what you going to use it for. 
(decouple)

use a main store.js to combine them into a store where we can 'dispatch' and 'select' when needed.
 
combine the slices/reducers and give them a key.
///
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    account: accountReducer,
    customer: customerReducer
})
const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;
///

useSelector (get information)
///
  const customer = useSelector(store => store.customer.fullName)
///
